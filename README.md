# Projects
C++ and Java 2-3 week projects - Emphasis on OOP, inheritance, data structures

## Overview
These projects were a way to challenge myself in ways that reflected the real world. Up until this point, my only experience was with
college assignments that were broken down for me so that I only had to impliment specific functions such as search, insert, and delete 
functions for various data structures. 

Along with implimenting various new techniques, these projects challenged me by:
- Starting from scratch -- there was no holding my hand this time -- 100% of the code is my own
- Giving me prompts that were open-ended and vague, which forced me to design well before I ever wrote a line of code
- Requiring specific data structures to be used. This time, however, they must all be recursively implimented
- Prompting me with a large program idea with a 2-3 week deadline with an expectation that I would not be able to finish

The point of these challenges was to overwhelm me. In order to tackle these projects, I learned about OOP, class inheritance, and UML
diagrams. With these basic tools and some practice, what seemed to be a solid mountain shattered into hundreds of puzzle pieces -- with
each piece being a manageable susbset of the whole.
