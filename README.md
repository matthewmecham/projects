# Projects
C++ and Java 2-3 week projects - Emphasis on OOP, inheritance, and data structures

## Overview
These projects were designed to challenge me in ways that reflected the real world. Up until this point, my only experience was with college assignments that were broken down for me so that I only had to implement specific functions such as search, insert, and delete functions for various data structures. 

Along with implementing various new techniques, these projects challenged me by:
- Starting from scratch -- there was no holding my hand this time -- 100% of the code is my own
- Giving me prompts that were open-ended and vague, which forced me to design well before I ever wrote a line of code
- Requiring specific data structures to be used. This time, however, they must all be recursively implemented
- Prompting me with a large program idea with a 2-3 week deadline alongside an expectation that I would not be able to finish

The point of these challenges was to overwhelm me. In order to tackle these projects, I learned about OOP, class inheritance, and UML diagrams. With these basic tools and some practice, what seemed to be a solid mountain shattered into hundreds of puzzle pieces -- each piece being a manageable susbset of the whole. 

This repository will contain foud different project folders. Within each folder, you will find the source code for my projects. Additionally, they will contain READMEs that go over the design prompt, my successes and failures, and instructions on how I compiled and ran my code.
